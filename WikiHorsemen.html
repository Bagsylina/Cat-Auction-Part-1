                    <h2>The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse</h2>
                    <p>The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are the strongest Cats that have been spotted in the real world. They take the form of small kittens, making them seem innofensive. However they are very dangerous dispite their appearance.</p>
                    <p>They are thought to have been the cause of the apocalypse, though it's not a proven fact. They seem to have taken the side of humans, despite not having the best opinions of them. They might side with humans, but if they are bothered too much, they can become hostile.</p>
                    <p>The Four Horsemen are, in order, Pestilence, War, Famine and Little Richard. Most of the times they act alone, but in very rare occasions they can be seen meeting eachother. Their true intentions are unknown, so it's best to be wary of them.</p>
